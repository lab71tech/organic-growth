description: Plan and start growing a new feature from seed
---

Grow a new feature using the Organic Growth approach.

1. Use the gardener agent in PLAN mode
2. Feature to grow: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning emphasis

The gardener will plan using property-based stages. When reviewing
the plan, focus on PROPERTIES (not implementation hints) — these
are the primary quality gate. Ask yourself:

- Are the properties complete? Could someone implement this WRONG
  and still pass all properties?
- Are properties from earlier stages preserved in later ones?
- Do the properties express domain rules, not implementation details?

## After planning

3. After the plan is created and approved, ask:
   "Plan ready. Start growing stage 1?"
4. If yes, immediately proceed with GROW mode for stage 1
