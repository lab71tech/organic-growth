description: Plan and start growing a new feature from seed
---

Grow a new feature using the Organic Growth approach.

1. Invoke the brainstorming skill to explore the problem space for: $ARGUMENTS
   Think broadly about approaches, risks, and edge cases before committing to a plan.
2. Use the gardener agent in PLAN mode
3. Feature to grow: $ARGUMENTS
4. When reviewing the plan, focus on PROPERTIES (not implementation hints) —
   these are the primary quality gate. Ask yourself:
   - Are the properties complete? Could someone implement this WRONG
     and still pass all properties?
   - Are properties from earlier stages preserved in later ones?
   - Do the properties express domain rules, not implementation details?
5. After the plan is created and approved, ask:
   "Plan ready. Start growing stage 1?"
6. If yes, immediately proceed with GROW mode for stage 1
