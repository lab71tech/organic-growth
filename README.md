# 🌱 Organic Growth

[![Test](https://github.com/lab71tech/organic-growth/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lab71tech/organic-growth/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lab71tech/organic-growth)](https://github.com/lab71tech/organic-growth/releases)

Claude Code setup for incremental software development.

Grow features in natural stages, where each stage delivers a complete, working system.

Inspired by Alistair Cockburn’s Elephant Carpaccio and the idea that projects grow like plants, rather than being sliced from a finished whole.

## Install

```bash
# In your project directory:
bunx organic-growth

# Or with npx:
npx organic-growth

# With a product DNA document:
bunx organic-growth docs/my-product-spec.md

# Force overwrite existing files:
bunx organic-growth --force
```

This copies the `.claude/` configuration into your project. No runtime dependencies.

## What You Get

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap (new project)
> /seed                          # interview mode
> /seed docs/product-dna.md      # from existing product document

# 2. Grow features
> /grow Add user authentication
> /next                          # stage 1
> /next                          # stage 2
> /next                          # stage 3
> /clear                         # fresh session every 3 stages
> /review 3                      # quality check
> /next                          # continue

# 3. When reality changes
> /replan We need to support SSO instead of basic auth
```

## Philosophy

- **One stage = one intent = one commit**
- **Rolling plan:** 3-5 stages ahead, re-evaluate every 3
- **Two-layer quality:** [properties](#property-based-planning) before code, deterministic tools after every stage, LLM review on demand
- **Context hygiene:** fresh session every 3 stages
- **Product context required:** fill in CLAUDE.md or provide a DNA document

## Property-Based Planning

Each growth stage defines **properties** — rules that must be true about the system — before any code is written.

Properties are not test cases or user stories. A test says "when I do X, Y happens." A property says "this rule always holds."

```
❌ Bad (scenario):  "When I click delete, the item is removed from the list"
✅ Good (property): "Deleting an item persists to storage and the item
                     count decreases by exactly one" [invariant]
```

**Why this matters for LLM-assisted development:** When Claude generates a stage, you review 3-5 properties instead of a 300-line diff. If the properties are right, the code is constrained to be right. The review shifts from "is this code correct?" to "are these rules complete?"

Properties **accumulate** across stages. Stage 3 must still satisfy the properties from stages 1 and 2. They are permanent commitments, not checkboxes to discard. This is what prevents regressions as the feature grows.

The gardener agent handles the full property format — categories, failure analysis, dependency tracking. See the [example growth plan](docs/example-growth-plan.md) for what this looks like in practice.

## After Install

1. Edit `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — fill in the Product section (or run `/seed`)
2. Fill in Quality Tools section with your project's lint/test commands
3. Start building with `/grow`

See the [example growth plan](docs/example-growth-plan.md) to see properties, stages, and accumulation in action.

## Parallel Growth with Worktrees

Organic growth uses `/clear` every 3 stages for temporal context hygiene — a fresh session prevents accumulated confusion. Git worktrees add a **spatial** dimension: each feature gets its own working directory. This lets you grow features in parallel, `/review` one while `/next`-ing another, or pause a feature without stashing.

Use `/worktree <feature-name>` to create a worktree with the right naming convention automatically.

**Naming convention:** match branch names to growth plan files. If the plan is `docs/growth/auth.md`, the branch is `auth`:

```bash
# Quick setup with the /worktree command
> /worktree auth

# Or manually:
git worktree add ../myproject-auth -b auth

# Work in it — separate directory, separate Claude Code session
cd ../myproject-auth && claude
> /grow Add user authentication

# When done, merge and clean up
git worktree remove ../myproject-auth
```

Each worktree has its own working tree, so `docs/growth/auth.md` lives on the `auth` branch and doesn't collide with growth plans on other branches.

## Releases

Releases are triggered manually via the [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow. When triggered, it:

1. Checks for meaningful commits since the last `v*` tag
2. Bumps the version in `package.json`
3. Commits the version bump and pushes a new `v*` tag
4. Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes

The [Publish to npm](.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow triggers on any `v*` tag push and publishes to npm automatically. The full pipeline is: **manual trigger -> version bump -> tag -> GitHub Release -> npm publish**.

```bash
# Patch release (default — bug fixes, small changes)
gh workflow run Release

# Minor release (new features, backwards-compatible)
gh workflow run Release -f bump=minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
gh workflow run Release -f bump=major

# Dry run — preview what would be released without making changes
gh workflow run Release -f dry-run=true
```

Or use the "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab in GitHub.

| Input | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `bump` | choice: `patch`, `minor`, `major` | `patch` | Version bump type |
| `dry-run` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, calculates the version and shows a summary but skips the commit, tag, and release |
